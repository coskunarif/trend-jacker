# TrendJacker Agent Playbook

This playbook is the source of truth for the autonomous development of TrendJacker. Future developer agents must read this file upon startup, brainstorm new ideas, update the backlog, select the highest-scoring task, and execute it.

---

## 🎯 Scoring Rubric
Each brainstormed task is scored out of **10 points** across four key areas:
1. **UX & Retention (UX)**: Does it hook the user in 3 seconds, look beautiful, and keep them engaged?
2. **SEO & GEO (SEO)**: Does it optimize for search engine rankings and AI model citations?
3. **Viral Potential (VIR)**: Does it drive shares, recommendations, and organic loops?
4. **Feasibility (FEAS)**: Can it be built cleanly, minimal dependencies, and under stateless serverless constraints?

**Formula**: `Total = UX + SEO + VIR + FEAS` (Max 40 points)

## 🛠️ Active Task Details: TJ-05
- **Objective**: Implement Google Cloud Firestore integration to persist sentiment voting data ("Genius vs Overrated") for trending topics.
- **Why**: Keeps poll scores intact across container recycles, restarts, and serverless scale-to-zero periods.
- **Execution Plan**:
  1. Add `@google-cloud/firestore` to `package.json` dependencies.
  2. Implement a Database module that initializes a Firestore client when running in production (using GCP Application Default Credentials) or falls back to a simple in-memory mock during local development.
  3. Replace the `pollStorage` in-memory `Map` inside `server.js` with the Database module to read/write poll state.
